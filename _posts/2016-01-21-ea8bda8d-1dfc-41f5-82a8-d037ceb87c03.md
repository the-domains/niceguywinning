"Looking for a CLEAN and easy healthy breakfast try this, amazing! Instead of syrup I always use a little honey (usually I just like it without) ALL NATURAL PANCAKE RECIPE... NO PROCESSED ANYTHING!!  
-- 1 ripe banana  
-- 2 whole eggs  
That's it. Just mix together in a bowl and make sure the banana is all mashed. Then spray your pan with some "spray & cook" or coconut oil. On a low to medium heat, scoop some of the batter into the pan & give it about 20-30 sec, flip, and done! Serve and eat!  
\*Some advice would be to make them small so its easier to flip  
Under 250 calories, nearly 14g of protein! No processed anything! These pancakes are gluten free, low calorie."  - [Ashley Horner Fitness][0]

Test:

Two eggs  
One banana  
Combine in magic bullet and fry low to medium heat for 1 min flip, fry for another 30 seconds.

They're even better than they look!  
Seriously I'm gonna eat this batch with no honey, no syrup, just as is.  
Kid approved.
